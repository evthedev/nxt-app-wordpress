<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Nxter.org ("<strong>Nxter.org</strong>") operates https://nxter.org and may operate other websites. It is Nxter.org's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
<p>We provide this privacy statement explaining our online information practices, so that you can decide whether and how to interact with the Site and the Services. By using our site, you consent to our privacy policy. This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our website and not to information collected offline. Please also review our Terms of Use section that governs the use and the users of the Site.</p>
<h2>Introduction.</h2>
<p>Nxter.org does not require you to enter any personal details. In fact, we encourage you to give us as little private information as possible. The only information we really need from you is an email address to contact you for update information and support purposes. The email address you use for signing up is therefore stored on our servers. When paying for services or goods (advertisement, subscriptions, shop items, asset issuer pages, premium plugins, etc) by credit card or bank transfer, your personal details will be collected by 3rd parties to facilitate the transaction and prevent fraud. If you care about your privacy, we recommend that you use NXT or Bitcoin as payment to retain anonymity and prevent fraud.</p>
<h2>Website Visitors.</h2>
<p>Like most website operators, Nxter.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Nxter.org's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Nxter.org's visitors use its website. From time to time, Nxter.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Nxter.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://nxter.org blogs/sites. Nxter.org only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information.</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to Nxter.org's websites choose to interact with Nxter.org in ways that require Nxter.org to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Nxter.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at&nbsp;<a href="http://nxthub.org/">https://nxter.org</a>&nbsp;to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Nxter.org may be asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Nxter.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Nxter.org. Nxter.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
<h2>Aggregated Statistics.</h2>
<p>Nxter.org may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Nxter.org may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Nxter.org does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information.</h2>
<p>Nxter.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Nxter.org's behalf or to provide services available at Nxter.org's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Nxter.org's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Nxter.org will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Nxter.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Nxter.org believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Nxter.org, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Nxter.org website and have supplied your email address, Nxter.org may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Nxter.org and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Nxter.org takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

Nxter.org visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Nxter.org's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Nxter.org's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h2>Business Transfers.</h2>
<p>If Nxter.org, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Nxter.org goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Nxter.org may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.

Your Nxt account is yours, not ours. Nxter.org or NxtBridge can not be held responsible if You lose your Nxt passphrase or a 3<sup>rd</sup> party gets hold of it, or for any consequence of you having lost it.

<p>It is the sole responsibility of the User to use NxtBridge OFFLINE only when the User is disconnected to the Internet. It is also the User&rsquo;s sole responsibility to check that the UNSIGNED transaction bytes which the User pastes into NxtBridge OFFLINE results in the exact transaction which the User wants to submit, before the User submits the SIGNED transaction provided by NxtBridge OFFLINE, in an online environment.</p>

Nxter.org does not hold any responsibility for the quality of the code and can not be held responsible for losses caused by using the plugin, its add-ons, NxtBridge OFFLINE or any feature on the Nxt blockchain, as it is a decentralized blockchain platform, run on a network of nodes, and the core code is provided by the Nxt core developers, IP held by Jelurida.</p>
